Overview of the Project

Project Title: Embedded System for Counting Button Presses

Objective: Design and implement an embedded system using a microcontroller to count and display the number of times a push button is pressed.

Hardware Components:
- Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
- Push button
- 16x2 LCD display (optional)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

Software Components:
- Arduino IDE
- C++ programming language

System Functionality:
1. Reads the state of the push button.
2. Debounces the button press to prevent multiple increments.
3. Increments a counter variable each time the button is pressed.
4. Displays the counter value on an LCD display (if used).
5. Prints the counter value to the serial monitor.

Key Features:
- Accurate counting of button presses using debouncing.
- Real-time display of counter value on LCD display (if used).
- Serial monitor output for debugging and testing.

Applications:
- Industrial automation
- IoT applications
- Robotics
- Home automation

This project demonstrates the basic principles of embedded systems design and programming using a microcontroller.
